## Setting up `elm-pkg-js` in a Javascript project.

Elm packages that follow the `elm-pkg-js` spec provide Port-based functionality that relies on some external Javascript.

`elm-pkg-js` automates the retrieval, verification and inclusion of that Javascript into an Elm project.


### Adding generated JS

```javascript
import { elmPkgJsInit } from "./elm-pkg-js-includes"

// After your Elm app has been initialised as you normally do
var app = Elm.Main.init(...)

// Pass it to the generated elm-pkg-js initialiser
elmPkgJsInit(app)
```

Now the provided `init` function for all installed `elm-pkg-js` packages will be run, allowing port subscriptions to be attached.


### Using `PkgPorts.elm`

The autogenerated `PkgPorts.elm` file has all the ports that installed `elm-pkg-js` packages expect.

Include it wherever a package expects a `PkgPorts ports msg` value.


For example, with the `supermario/copy-to-clipboard` package:


```elm
import PkgPorts exposing (ports)
import Clipboard

-- In your update function
update msg model =
    case msg of
        SomeMsg ->
            ( model, Clipboard.copy ports "some string" )
```



### Verifying `elm-pkg-js` Javascript contents

```
elm-pkg-js verify
